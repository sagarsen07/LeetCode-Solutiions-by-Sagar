# LeetCode-Solutions-by-Sagar

hey coders, i have created one more repository in order to share my work and knowledge to help my junios or new learners and also to get recognisation from the seniors in the industry.
In this repository i will share the solutions of the leetCode problems in C++ through which you can take help in logic building. all the code that will be uploaded here will be in C++ and i will try in near future to share the same in other languages as soon as i get hands on that language.
one thing i would like to mention here is that do not copy paste the code from here, this will bring no change in you. You might get the temproary satisfaction of submitting the olution but it will not help you in your career and will put you in fake reality so just see the solution and understand it then code it on your own.
hope you guys will support me..... :)
happy learning
Thankyou...
